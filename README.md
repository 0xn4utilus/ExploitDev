First of all to create an exploit from a executable file we need to analyze it

We can analyze any file using two methods
	
	- Static Analysis
	- Dynamic Analysis

## STATIC ANALYSIS

Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs

Static Analysis is nothing but analysing static data from a file

Information which can be obtained from Static Analysis are,

	- Metadata
	- Header Tags
	- Function Names
	- String Values
	- etc..

Commonly used tools for Static Analysis in Linux are,

	- strings
	- readelf
	- objdump
	- file


## DYNAMIC ANALYSIS

Dynamic program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed by executing programs on a real or virtual processor

So to analyze the behaviour of the executable file in memeory and environment, we need Debuggers to monitor the file

Commonly used Debuggers are,

	- GDB
	- GDB-PEDA
	- IDA Pro
	- Immunity Debugger
	- OllyDbg
	- Hopper
