# Return Oriented Programming (ROP) Attack

-----

## ROP

ROP is a special binary exploitation technique that performs our desired exploit within the program's address space and it uses certain region where ASLR is not used for randomization

## ROP CHAIN

Return Oriented Programming Chain is a combination of return addresses used to perform a sequential calling of the functions within the program to perform ROP attack

It is similar to [ret2libc](https://aidenpearce369.github.io/posts/ret2libc-spawn-shell.html) where we use system() and exit() pointing one after another

But here it is more than that

## RET

Return instruction (RET) is used to to transfer the program flow from the current sub routine to top of the stack frame

RET also uses arguments to perform "near/far return"
