# LINUX BINARY/EXECUTABLE PROTECTIONS

## NX BIT

NX - Non Executable

This a protective mechanism which makes the data in stack non executable

If NX bit is enabled,you can't execute your shellcode in stack so that exploit does not works

It throws SEGMENTATION FAULT

It is commonly refered as DEP(Data Execution Prevention) on Windows Side

No Execute (NX) is similar to Execute Disable Bit (XD) on other processors

Common method to bypass NX bit is to use "Ret2Libc" attack

## ASLR

ASLR - Address Space Layout Randomization

When ASLR is turned on it randomizes the address for each components of the program in the memory whenever it is being called

ASLR value is stored in ```/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space```

If ASLR value is 0, then ASLR is disabled

If ASLR value is 1, the stack, the virtual dynamic shared object page, and the shared memory regions are randomized

If ASLR value is 2, the data segments are randomized too

To change ASLR values via terminal,

```
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

or

```
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

To disable ASLR in GDB debugger

```
set disable-randomization off
```

ASLR can be bypassed by bruteforcing the address from the memory

But it is not efficient for modern systems and the success probability is very less

## STACK CANARY

Stack canary is also known as stack gaurd or stack protector
