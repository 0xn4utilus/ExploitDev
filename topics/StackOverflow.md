# STACK OVERFLOW

## BUFFERS

A buffer is defined as a limited, contiguously allocated set of memory which is used to store variables

Stack overflows are possible because no inherent bounds-checking exists on buffers in the C or C++ languages

It happens because it has no built-in function to ensure that data being copied into a buffer will not be larger than the buffer can hold

When a programmer creates a buffer that has the potential to be overflowed and then compiles and runs the code, the program often crashes or does not function as expected

##### "***** Segmentation Fault / Core Dumped *****"

#### NOTE

"PUSH" instruction is used to place the data on top of the stack

"POP" instruction is used to remove the data from the stack

## GOALS OF STACKOVERFLOW

1. Bypass Authentication

2. Spawning Shell

3. Overwriting data and functions

4. Privilege Escalation

5. Denial of Service and so on..
